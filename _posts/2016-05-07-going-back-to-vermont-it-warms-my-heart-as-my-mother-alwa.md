description: 'Going back to Vermont, it "warms my heart" as my mother always said, it must be in my blood; her people being for generations from the Northeast Kingdom. My generation has a different life, not the stay and survive life that was usual in an area with long, frozen winters. My Spring move from Spain back to Vermont is approaching in a few weeks and I am itching to smell the damp woods. '

Our last month in Mallorca, Spain - let's make Juicy Lamb Burgers. Great ingredients make the best burgers, lean beef and fresh ground lamb. Add fine chopped white onions and free range eggs - and finally, a savory, strong cheese that will ooze out of your burger with that first big bite!

Mallorca is America from 100 years ago, and what it is coming back to. Before the industrial revolution brought canned goods and instant flavorings to our big supermarkets. In Mallorca you still follow the daily markets around the island to purchase the freshest ingredients, or forage the seasonal wild growing herbs and vegetables. Mallorca still has butchers, fish mongers and local cheeses - it is the exception to find plastic packaged meat at your grocers. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d31555bd-8d24-46aa-97d1-2ea592d1436f.jpg)

Soon I will be back in the land of cheddar cheese and grass fed beef, and my Vermont burgers will be spectacular - but for now we will use tender Mallorcan lamb, and strong goat cheese from Mallorca - Yum!

RECIPE FOR JUICY CHEESE FILLED LAMB BURGERS

* 1 lb. ground lamb or 1/2 lb. each lamb and lean beef
* 1/2 white onion finely chopped (fresh sweet onion is best)
* 1/2 tsp. salt (not iodized)
* 1/2 tsp. fresh ground pepper
* 1 fresh chicken egg

Mix egg, salt and pepper together. Add the lamb and/or beef and mix thoroughly with you hands (it will not combine as well if you don't use your hands!). ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5845864b-dc86-4d41-bce5-be59bebbe4ad.jpg)

Take a good hand full of burger and form it into a ball, then flatten it and make an indent in the middle. Into this indent put a chunk of cheese (about 1" by 1/2" - bigger if it fits!). Pull the meat up around the cheese so it is covered and flatten it back into a thick burger shape. 

Grill as usual on charcoal or gas, with our [Vermont Country Basalt Grillstone][0] it will be juicier and more flavorful! For added yumminess cover with a slice of cheese, bacon and a bun that has grilled on the Grillstone for a few minutes!
